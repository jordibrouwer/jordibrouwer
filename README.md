# Hi, I'm Jordi Brouwer 👋

I'm an enthusiastic hobbyist from Leiden (NL) who loves tinkering with tech. With a strong focus on **automation**, self‑hosting, and practical solutions, just for fun.. I enjoy working on projects where infrastructure, scripting, and home automation come together – and I combine that with a strong passion for (aerial) photography. Most of what you'll find here are small experiments, random ideas, and tools I built to make things a bit easier (or just because I can 😄).

## Luchtlens – A different perspective

Besides my work with computers, I run, for fun, **Luchtlens**, a personal project where I combine my love for drones and photography. 
With Luchtlens, I capture Leiden and its surroundings from above, showing familiar places from a completely new perspective – from historic city centers and churches to parks, infrastructure and local landmarks. 

- 🌍 Focus on Leiden and the Leiden region, with occasional flights elsewhere in the Netherlands. 
- 🚁 Flying with modern camera drones to create high‑resolution photos, panoramas and short videos.   
- 🎯 Goal: capturing places, moments and stories that you only truly see once you go up in the air.
